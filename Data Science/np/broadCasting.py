# Broadcasting two arrays together follows these rules:

# If the arrays do not have the same rank, prepend the shape
# of the lower rank array with 1s until both shapes have the
# same length.
# The two arrays are said to be compatible in a dimension
# if they have the same size in the dimension, or if one of
# the arrays has size 1 in that dimension.
# The arrays can be broadcast together if they are compatible
# in all dimensions.
# After broadcasting, each array behaves as if it had shape
# equal to the elementwise maximum of shapes of the two input
# arrays.
# In any dimension where one array had size 1 and the other
# array had size greater than 1, the first array behaves as
# if it were copied along that dimension
